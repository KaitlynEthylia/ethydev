			<h1>How to Play Mulligan</h1>
			
			<hr/>
			<h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>Mulligan is a card game that blends strategy with social negotiation
as each player tries to navigate a series of trades and auctions to
try and get the best hand possible by the end of the game, without
accidentally giving an opponent exactly what they need to beat you.
The game is best played with three to six people, but it works with
any number greater than one.</p>
<p>Mulligan is a game I created myself when I was bored one day and
couldn’t find any fun card games. I’m sure it has a lot of glaring
flaws, but it was made in under 24 hours, and so far I’ve found it
pretty fun, and I’m very open to feedback to improve it.</p>
<h2 id="setup" tabindex="-1">Setup</h2>
<p>At the start of the game, each player is drawn a hand of 5 cards. You
never reveal your hand to the other players. The remaining cards are
placed face-down in the middle of the table in the <em>deck pile</em>. Next to the <em>deck
pile</em> is the <em>discard pile</em>. This will start empty.</p>
<p>In a circle around the <em>deck</em> and <em>discard piles</em> is the <em>trade ring</em>. The <em>trade ring</em> begins
empty as well. Each player has a single slot on the <em>trade ring</em>, where they
will place their <em>auctioned card</em>, or their <em>offers</em> for somebody else’s card.</p>
<p>Once the hands have been dealt and the remaining cards
placed in the <em>deck pile</em>, pick somebody to take the first turn.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-loop" tabindex="-1">The Game Loop</h2>
<p>On each turn, whoever’s turn it is (the ‘<em>auctioneer</em>’) gets the
choice of three actions. They may <strong>Skip</strong>, <strong>Auction</strong>, or <strong>Fold</strong>. <em>Skip</em> is
fairly self-explanatory. If the <em>auctioneer</em> chooses to <em>Skip</em>, then
their turn immediately ends, and the <em>active player</em> to their left (clockwise)
becomes the new <em>auctioneer</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To begin with, all players are ‘<em>active</em>’. <em>Inactive</em> players are explained later.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="auction" tabindex="-1">Auction</h3>
<p>Auctions are at the centre of this game, and are how players are able
to improve their hands. When the <em>auctioneer</em> chooses to <em>auction</em>, they select
a card from their hand, and place it face-up on the <em>trade ring</em>. This
card is called the <em>auctioned card</em>. At this point the <em>auctioneer</em> can no
longer choose to skip their turn. If they have auctioned a card on the
<em>trade ring</em>, they will not have that card at the end of the turn.</p>
<p>After the <em>auctioned card</em> is presented, every other <em>active player</em> must make an
<em>offer</em> for the <em>auctioned card</em>; They place their <em>offer</em> face down on the
<em>trade ring</em>. After all <em>active players</em> have a card on the <em>trade ring</em>,
all of the <em>offers</em> are switched to face-up position.</p>
<p>At this point, the <em>auctioneer</em> has two choices. They can choose to
<strong>Swap</strong> the <em>auctioned card</em> with one of the <em>offers</em>, or they can choose to
<strong>Mulligan</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="swap" tabindex="-1">Swap</h3>
<p>If the <em>auctioneer</em> chooses to <em>Swap</em>, Then they take one of the <em>offers</em> from the
<em>trade ring</em>, and place it in their hand. The player they swapped with, takes the
<em>auctioned card</em> and adds it to their hand. All other active players retrieve their
original <em>offer</em> from the <em>trade ring</em> and return it their hand.</p>
<h4 id="mulligan" tabindex="-1">Mulligan</h4>
<p>If the <em>auctioneer</em> decides none of the <em>offers</em> will help them,
then they may choose to <em>Mulligan</em>. In a <em>Mulligan</em>, all cards in the
trade ring are sent face-up to the <em>discard pile</em>, and each of the players are
drawn a new card from the <em>deck pile</em>. Cards in the <em>discard pile</em> are dead; They will never
circulate in the game again.</p>
<h3 id="fold" tabindex="-1">Fold</h3>
<p>A <em>Fold</em> is an action the <em>auctioneer</em> takes once they are happy with their
hand; They do not think they can get a better hand, and do not want to
risk being forced to lose a card. When the auctioneer folds, as though they
had chosen to skip their turn, their turn ends immediately. After <em>folding</em>,
a player becomes <em>innactive</em>. This means that they no longer participate in
auctions, they no longer have a turn, and their hand becomes frozen for the
rest of the game.</p>
<h2 id="end-states" tabindex="-1">End States</h2>
<p>There are two ways for the game to end. If there are only two <em>active
players</em>, and one of them chooses to fold, then the game ends.
Alternatively, if there are no longer sufficient cards in
the deck pile to draw a new card for each <em>active player</em> (immediately
following a <em>Mulligan</em>), then the game must also end.</p>
<h3 id="2-players-remain" tabindex="-1">2 Players Remain</h3>
<p>When there are only two <em>active players</em> remaining, the
game still functions as normal. The <em>trade ring</em> will just have a single
<em>offer</em>. Once either of these players fold, the game ends, and the other
player is also forced to fold.</p>
<h3 id="the-deck-nears-empty" tabindex="-1">The Deck Nears Empty</h3>
<p>Immediately after dealing cards following a mulligan, if there are no
longer enough cards in the <em>deck pile</em> to deal for every player, then the game ends. Any
left-over cards are revealed and then sent to the <em>discard pile</em>.</p>
<h2 id="win-condition" tabindex="-1">Win Condition</h2>
<p>Once the game has ended, all players reveal their hands. The winner is the
player with the most valuable hand, just like in poker and many other
card games. Similarly, most of the hand evaluations are very similar
to poker.</p>
<h3 id="hand-evaluation" tabindex="-1">Hand Evaluation</h3>
<p>The possible types of hands are as follows, in order of least valuable
to most valuable, with an example in brackets:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Card: A single card. Your hand does not fit any of the other
valid hands (♠A)</li>
<li>Pair: Two cards of the same value. (♥6 ♦6)</li>
<li>Two Pair: Two pairs. (♦J ♠J ♠4 ♣4)</li>
<li>Low Straight: Four consecutive cards. (♥J ♥Q ♠K ♦A)</li>
<li>Three-of-a-Kind: Three cards of the same value (♦9 ♥9 ♣9)</li>
<li>High Straight: Five consecutive cards. (♦10 ♥J ♥Q ♠K ♦A)</li>
<li>Flush: Five cards of the same suit. (♠5 ♠A ♠J ♠7 ♠2)</li>
<li>Full House: Two of the same card + Three of the same card (♠3 ♦3 ♦3 ♦6 ♠6)</li>
<li>Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value (♦4 ♣4 ♥4 ♠4)</li>
<li>Straight Flush: Five consecutive cards, all of the
same suit. (♠10 ♠J ♠Q ♠K ♠A)</li>
</ul>
<p>The of cards that determine the value of your hand are called your ‘<em>value hand</em>’.
If you have a three-of-a-kind, then the three cards making it up, are your
<em>value hand</em>, and the rest of the cards in your hand are ignored.</p>
<p>Full House,</p>
<h4 id="high-ace-and-low-ace" tabindex="-1">High Ace and Low Ace</h4>
<p>As usual, an Ace can count as both as the lowest card, and as the
highest card. However it can only serve one of these rolls at once. By
default, it is a high ace, meaning it wins against any other high
cards. It only serves as a low ace in straights, where it may be
adjacent to a two. However, as it can only be low or high (and never
both), you cannot have a straight that goes from king, to ace, to two.</p>
<h4 id="card-value" tabindex="-1">Card Value</h4>
<p>If two players have the same type of hand, whoever’s <em>value hand</em> has the
single highest valued card wins.</p>
<h4 id="suit-value" tabindex="-1">Suit Value</h4>
<p>On the very rare occasion that two value hands are of the same type and have
the same highest card, i.e. A low straight where both players have a
straight from three to six, then the suit of each highest card is
compared. This is rarely important but it does mean that some suits
are very slightly more valuable with others. In the example, whichever
of these two players has the six in the straight with the most
valuable suit wins</p>
<p>The suits values are as follows:</p>
<p>Spades &gt; Hearts &gt; Clubs &gt; Diamonds</p>
<p>Making Spades the most valuable suit, and Diamonds the least valuable.</p>
